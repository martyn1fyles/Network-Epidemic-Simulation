# HCV-Networks
A repository of code I created for modelling HCV on networks. The majority of the work is done on implementing a Sellke Solver for 

# Testing
Code testing is performed using pytest

#To Do List
1****) Unit test all of the code thus far
2) Set up Jenkins to test all of the code each day

1) Implement Sellke on a network with constant force of infection
2) Change the well-mixed population variant to have non-constant force of infection via ODE solver
3) Implement the non-constant force of infection on a network via an ODE solver
