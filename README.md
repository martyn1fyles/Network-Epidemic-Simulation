## Sellke-Simulator
Sellke_Networks is a repository with a focus on simulating epidemics on networks. In particular, we allow for epidemics with time varying infectious profiles (non-Markovian epidemics). Additionally, we are interested in dynamic networks, where edges are allowed to be time varying, nodes have a birth death process and nodes may change group membership at the time points of different processes.

# Current Features
1) Time-varying infection profiles
2) SIR epidemics on a static network

# In progress
1) SIS epidemics
2) Birth/Death Processes for nodes
3) Group membership processes

# Notebooks
We have several notebooks demostrating usage of the simulations, in order to prove the validity of our results. We demonstrate our code correctly reproduces the results of known examples in these notebooks.

# Testing
The code is thorouhgly tested, so that you can be assured of the validity of the results. In our notebooks we produce results that show that the behaviour of the code is as expected for some known results.
